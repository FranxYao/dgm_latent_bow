## Some guidelines

The file `journal.md` documents your progress. It contains dated entries with a
description of what you are up to, what you found, what you are thinking, and so on.
Update and commit/push at least once a week. 

The `doc/` directory contains latex documents that you are writing.  Templates will be provided.

The `src/` directory contains the code you are writing.

The `etc/` directory contains anything elseâ€”materials, notes, photos of white-
boards, and so on that you want to keep track of.

The `loc/` directory will have private "local" contents: nothing you include here will be pushed to our shared repo.  Use this sparingly, if at all.

Feel free to have other directories too, such as `dat/`, `out/`, and `fig/` (keep names short).

Commit early and often, at least once a week.  

Note: repo structure inherited from Dave; thanks Dave.
